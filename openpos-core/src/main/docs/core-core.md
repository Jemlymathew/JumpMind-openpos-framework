At its heart, Nu-Commerce based applications are web applications based on a Model View Controller pattern.

  * The View component is based on an HTML 5 / Javascript front end utilizing the Angular.IO framework and Material Design.
  * The Controller is comprised of a state machine that coordinates between the View layer and the Model layer.  
  * The Model is a set of Services and support libraries that offer both business logic as well as data persistence for the application.
